                                        Your back is a complex series of bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles, all of
                                        which can be
                                        a source of pain.
                                        In addition, stress, poor posture, arthritis, imbalances, pregnancy and obesity
                                        may
                                        contribute to the development of lower back pain.
                                        Accidents or sports injuries can be a primary source of traumatic back pain,
                                        sometimes the
                                        simplest of movements can have painful results.
                                        You will be asked a series of questions and implement a variety of diagnostic
                                        tests to
                                        determine the most probable cause of your back pain.
                                        If you are suffering from lower back and pelvic pain, chiropractic care can be a
                                        very
                                        effective method to restore your mobility and decrease your levels of pain and

                                    <h2>Shoulder Pain</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Your shoulder is a very complex joint. A properly functioning shoulder allows
                                        for optimal
                                        movement during reaching, pulling and pushing. The shoulder has the ability to
                                        move in a
                                        wide range of directions and planes. Unfortunately, this wide range of motion
                                        makes it more
                                        prone to injury. This increases the likelihood of joint injury, leading to a
                                        degenerative
                                        process in which tissues break down and no longer function well.
                                        Commonly diagnosed shoulder injuries include rotator cuff tears or tendonitis,
                                        frozen
                                        shoulder, shoulder impingement and bursitis. Diagnosis of shoulder pain can be
                                        challenging
                                        for health practitioners and frustrating for you as a patient.
                                        Shoulder pain is frequently assessed and treated. Effective treatments for
                                        chronic shoulder
                                        pain are Chiropractic adjustments, combined with other soft tissue treatment
                                        such as
                                        strapping, dry needling, FAKTR and sports massage.

                                        Upper back pain and pain between shoulder blades is often experienced by
                                        patients, due to
                                        the fact that many of us sit during the day at a computer workstation.
                                        Long hours at our desks can put a lot of extra pressure on the joints in the

                                        region and specifically the joints between the ribs and the spine (the

                                        By the end of the day, we can end up in suboptimal postural positions causing
                                        our ribs and
                                        joints to become stuck.
                                        This pain can feel dull and achy in the upper back or a sharp stabbing pain
                                        through the
                                        chest or upper back.
                                        The pain can sometimes also radiate outwards away from the spine and around to
                                        the side and
                                        front of the chest.
                                        To restore proper motion to the costovertebral joints in the upper back and
                                        chest area is
                                        very simple and effective.
                                        With Chiropractic care a gentle spinal adjustment, encourages proper movement
                                        and joint
                                        function and decreases both upper back and chest pain.

                                        Your neck begins at the base of the skull and contains small vertebrae which
                                        connect the
                                        head to the body.
                                        The neck supports the full weight of your head and protects the nerves that
                                        carry sensory
                                        and motor information from the brain to the rest of the body.
                                        The neck is highly flexible allowing your head to move in nearly every
                                        direction.
                                        This flexibility makes the neck very susceptible to pain and injury and is also
                                        subject to a
                                        lot of stress.
                                        Neck pain and spasms are common problems for many of us. When a neck spasm hits,
                                        even the
                                        slightest movement can cause intense pain. Although the spasms are usually
                                        short-lived, they
                                        can become a chronic problem in some cases. In both acute and chronic cases a
                                        visit to your
                                        chiropractor is highly recommended as it will decrease the pain in the

                                        A headache is the symptom of pain in the face, head, or neck. It can occur
                                        occasionally or
                                        frequently either as a migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache.
                                        Research has shown headaches can occur as a result of many conditions and can be
                                        effectively
                                        treated conservatively with Chiropractic care, exercise and stretches.
                                        Chiropractors are trained to identify various types of headaches and to provide

                                        TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT PAIN (TMJ pain)<br>
                                        For some, pain or discomfort in the jaw muscles is temporary and often occurs in
                                        cycles, and
                                        resolves once movement in the area stops. For others, chronic TM joint pain,
                                        will notice
                                        constant pain and dysfunction in the jaw region. Chiropractic treatment may
                                        include
                                        mobilizations, instrument assisted soft tissue therapy or Functional Dry

                                        Primary Ear Pain may arise from problems within the ear such as infections,
                                        inflammation,
                                        direct trauma, perforation of the tympanic membrane and problems with the
                                        Eustachian tube.
                                        Secondary Ear Pain may be refered pain from other body parts. These include
                                        sinuses, teeth,
                                        the spine, jaw and throat. In some cases pain arising from a problem in these
                                        areas will
                                        radiate out and away from the source towards the ear.
                                        If you have been experiencing persistent ear pain and have had other primary

                                        There are two Sacroiliac joints, (SI joint) on either side, with ligaments that
                                        hold the
                                        bones together, located at the base of the lower back which connects the pelvis
                                        to the
                                        spine.
                                        Patients often describe their pain as originating in their "lower back or hip
                                        and buttock
                                        area". This makes Sacroiliac joint pain difficult to diagnose as it can also be
                                        referred
                                        pain in the thigh and leg.
                                        The true hip joints are located in a different location and pain may radiate out
                                        from the SI
                                        joints to the sides of the body towards the hips, causing confusion about where
                                        the pain is
                                        actually originating.
                                        Common features of SI joint pain can include:
                                        Pain on one or both sides over the pelvic joints and into the buttocks. Pain in
                                        the buttock,
                                        back of the leg, front of the thigh or deep in the groin. Pain is often noticed
                                        after
                                        lifting or twisting or can develop gradually or suddenly. Pain is worse when
                                        sitting.
                                        SI joint pain can be aggravated with:
                                        Prolonged sitting or standing. Standing on one leg. Forward bending. Stair
                                        climbing. Going
                                        from sit to stand. Running. Rolling over is an aggravating factor when lying
                                        down.

                                    <p>
                                        Sciatica most commonly occurs when a herniated disc, bone spur on the spine or
                                        narrowing of
                                        the spine compresses part of the nerve or a tight/spasmed/inflamed muscle,
                                        tendon or
                                        ligament. Pain radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from
                                        your lower
                                        back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. This causes inflammation,
                                        pain and
                                        often some pins and needles or numbness in the affected leg.
                                        True injury to the sciatic nerve “sciatica” is rare, but the term “sciatica” is
                                        used to
                                        describe pain originating in the lower back and radiates down the leg.
                                        Causes for sciatica include an injury or previous injury, obesity, lack a strong
                                        core. Have
                                        an active physical job. Lack proper posture. Diabetes, Osteoarthritis. Lead an

                                    <h2>Knee, Ankle and Foot Pain</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Common complaints felt by people of all ages are knee, ankle and foot pain. Knee
                                        pain can
                                        occur due to a variety of reasons such as a trauma, a fall onto the knee or
                                        sport injury.
                                        In women, knee pain is common due to our increased pelvic/knee angle and because
                                        of hormones
                                        and connective tissue types.
                                        People with tighter quads and hamstrings often experience Patellar tendonitis.
                                        Hip and pelvic joint dysfunction are common factors which contribute to the
                                        development of
                                        knee pain. Similarly, dysfunction in the ankles and feet can also be a factor in
                                        the
                                        development of knee pain.
                                        Athletes experience ankle and foot pain sometime during their training as ankle
                                        joints can
                                        easily become jammed during athletic activities causing pain.
                                        Some other injuries can include ankle sprains, peroneal tendonitis and achilles
                                        tendonitis,
                                        which can all be effectively treated.
                                        Chiropractic care can be effective in finding and addressing the source of your
                                        pain by
                                        frequently assessing the full kinetic chain (hip, knee, ankle and foot) to see
                                        where the
                                        restrictions originate, ensuring all joints are moving properly.

                                        neck to your elbow, to your wrist or even into your hand.
                                        Through a series of specific tests, your pain will be assessed to see where it

                                        ages. Even the most uncomplicated birth can place an enormous amount of stress
                                        and tension
                                        on a baby's spine and skull during childbirth. This strain can interfere with

                                        pains as adults do. These aches and pains can be due to the countless bumps and
                                        falls that
                                        are an inevitable part of childhood. Poor posture from carrying heavy bags to
